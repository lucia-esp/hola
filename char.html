            <h1 class="char-name">Tom Nook</h1>
            <img id="tom-pic" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/72/Tom_Nook.png">
            <p>Tom Nook (たぬきち, Tanukichi) is a character who plays the most important role in all of the games. He is termed a raccoon in the western versions of the game but a tanuki in the Japanese version. In all games leading to New Leaf, he is the manager of the town shop. After the final expansion, Nookington's, he will employ his "nephews" Timmy and Tommy, who work on the second floor in every Animal Crossing series game except Animal Crossing: New Leaf. However, in New Leaf, Nook has taken his interest in real estate to a whole new level, opening Nook's Homes, whilst Timmy and Tommy run the town shop.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the City Folk's game guide this description is given:</p>
                    <p class="descrip"><em>"A kind raccoon with a heart of gold (well, pockets of gold even though he only owns a shop, if ya know what I mean), Tom Nook helps you get started when you first move to town by loaning you a home to live in. Tom also runs a little supply shop in town that sells all the basics, including furniture, tools, and gardening supplies. Tom will help you in a variety of ways as your life unfolds, and you'll help him as well: keep shopping at the store and it'll get bigger and bigger. Eventually, old Tom will even need to hire his two nephews, Timmy and Tommy, just to keep his business running!"</em></p>

            <h1 class="char-name">Isabelle</h1>
            <img id="isabelle-pic" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/animalcrossing/images/2/26/Isabelle_AF.png/revision/latest?cb=20161008142729">
            <p>Isabelle (しずえ Shizue) is a dog who debuts in New Leaf. She assists the player in whose new role as the town mayor as a secretary and assistant. She is also the twin sister of Digby, who works and stands at the front entrance to the Happy Home Showcase. She also appeared in games after New Leaf.</p>
            <p>Isabelle is very clumsy, absentminded, and dislikes confrontation. Despite this, she is respectful of others and is very friendly. Being open-minded and outgoing, she is very keen to make the town a better place to live in by encouraging the player to do tasks and Public Works Projects throughout the town. Like many other secretaries, she can be hard on herself when she is side-tracked, and as a compulsive workaholic, she neglects her physical health in the name of her occupation. Isabelle has shown sides of gratitude and affection to the player, especially on Valentine's Day and is even hinted on having a crush on the player regardless of gender</p>

            <h1 class="char-name">Digby</h1>
            <img id="digby-pic" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/animalcrossing/images/9/99/Kent.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/150?cb=20140626081047">
            <p>Digby (ケント, Kento) is a dog who is in charge of the Happy Home Showcase in New Leaf, and is the twin brother of Isabelle. He can be seen standing at the Showcase's entrance all day long.
                In order to get into the Showcase, the player must first speak with him. Once inside, the player may visit the houses of other players they have met through StreetPass.</p>
            <p>In Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer, he is a normal staff member at Nook's Homes and can help you with rebuilding facilities you have already built. You unlock this feature after upgrading the school with Isabelle.</p>
            <p>In Pocket Camp, he returns to work at the Happy Home Academy, but instead of being the gatekeeper of the Happy Home Showcase, he is one of the Happy Homeroom Judges.</p>
            <p>Digby has a relaxed personality much like his sister, Isabelle. He is patient and very straight-forward, although he sometimes feels concerned about his job being the gate guard of the Happy Home Showcase area. He also gets along with his sister Isabelle, as she does also.</p>

            <h1 class="char-name">K.K. Slider</h1>
            <img id="kk-pic" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/animalcrossing/images/8/8d/KKSliderNL.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/175?cb=20130729111157">    
            <p>K.K. Slider (とたけけ, Totakeke), commonly known as K.K., or DJ K.K. is a dog who appears in all of the Animal Crossing series games to date. He works as a musician, playing songs on his guitar. In Animal Crossing, he could be found near the train station; Wild World and City Folk had him playing in The Roost café; whereas New Leaf saw him move to working in Club LOL. His birthday was revealed in Animal Crossing Plaza. Like other special characters that appear in the Animal Crossing series, he does not celebrate it.</p>
            <p>K.K. Slider is a hippie-style traveling musician, which is reflected in his mellow speech towards the player. He comes across as someone who wants to be liberated, as shown by his rebellion against putting a price on his songs. This adds to the musician stereotype of going against a particular norm. Despite that, his songs are for sale in New Leaf for 3,200 bells when Timmy and Tommy upgraded to T.I.Y.</p>
            <p>K.K. has an obvious passion for performing for others, as he offers to play for people on a weekly basis.</p>

            <h1 class="char-name">Resetti</h1>
            <img id="reset-pic" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Resetti.png">
            <p>Resetti (リセットさん, Risetto san, Mr. Reset), also known as Mr. Resetti, is a very cranky mole that appears in all the Animal Crossing series games. His job is to make sure that all players save continuously throughout gameplay. The more the player resets within the Animal Crossing games (or turns off the power without saving), the harsher he gets, so people must make sure that they save their game. In certain installments, resetting the game too many times will lead to either a "fake" reset in Animal Crossing and in Wild World, mentioning about his cousin Vicious Vole Vinnie (Possibly referencing the movie My Cousin Vinny). When Resetti's calmer, older brother Don Resetti appears, he will reveal Resetti's first name as "Sonny" in both Animal Crossing and City Folk.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h1 class="char-name">Blathers</h1>
            <img id="blathers-pic" src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/animalcrossing/images/5/5e/Blathers_-_Animal_Crossing_New_Leaf.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20130807000633">
            <p>Blathers (フータ, Fūta, Hooter) is a knowledgeable owl scholar and Museum director. Blathers first appeared in Animal Forest+ and has appeared in every Animal Crossing series game since. Players can patronize the Museum by bringing Blathers donations of fish, insects, fossils and paintings. As an owl, Blathers sleeps during the daytime, though players can still wake him up to donate to the Museum.</p>
            <p>Blathers has entomophobia (the fear of insects) and brings this somewhat ironic trait up frequently. In all games, if the player donates a bug that has been donated previously, he will reject it and plead that the cage is kept closed until the player has left the building.</p>
            <p>He can also give the player information on the museum, such as exhibitions, what has been donated and by whom in every game from Wild World onward. Blathers was seen on the cover of Animal Crossing, standing on the roof. He has reappeared in New Leaf, running the Museum as usual.</p>
